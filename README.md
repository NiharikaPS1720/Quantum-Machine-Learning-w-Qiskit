# Quantum-Machine-Learning-w-Qiskit
Logistic Regression and Quantum Variational Classifier on a dataset

Dataset on factors that contribute to heart failure- downloaded from Kaggle

Classical Ml logistic regression algorithm from scikit-learn performed
Two factors that most contributed to heart failure were selected from results

Quantum Variational Algortihm run with simulation of two qubits using qiskit
Accuracies of different circuits recorded
